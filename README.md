# Bank Assets Manager

A simplified, blockchain-backed banking system developed as part of the **Information Assurance** (IA) course project. This Python-based application ensures secure and auditable asset transfers between bank accounts using fundamental blockchain principles, emphasizing data integrity, non-repudiation, and availability.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project simulates a **Bank Asset Manager** with integrated **blockchain ledgering** to:
- Record every transaction immutably.
- Provide traceable and auditable asset transfers.
- Ensure secure account operations.
- Demonstrate real-world application of Information Assurance principles.

## 🔐 Information Assurance Principles Applied

- **Integrity**: Transactions are stored on a tamper-evident blockchain to ensure data consistency.
- **Availability**: Account and blockchain data is persistently saved to JSON files.
- **Authentication & Non-repudiation**: Each transaction requires a valid sender and receiver, and once mined, cannot be altered.
- **Accountability**: Complete transaction history is visible through the blockchain.
